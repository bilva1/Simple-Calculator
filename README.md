The Simple Calculator is a Java-based application built using Java Swing to provide a sleek, dark mode interface for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a well-organized GUI with a JTextField to display input/output, and buttons arranged using GridLayout for seamless interaction. The UI includes hover effects on buttons, enhancing user experience with smooth transitions. The application uses ActionListener for handling user input, performing calculations, and displaying results. It also supports a clear function and handles edge cases like division by zero. This project demonstrates event-driven programming and UI design with Java, providing a clean, professional look while being functional and interactive.
